# An Area calculator

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

This is just a simple calculator that calculates area of diffrent shapes and structures currently it calculates the area of circle and rectangle, but more shapes can be adden to it  


## Background

It can solve the problem of calculating area of different shapes, you don't need to remember the fromluas just select the shape and there you go you have your answer


## How is it used?

It's very useful for people who need to calculate areas of different shape regularly, it'll save their time and make the more productive.


## Data sources and AI methods
Data used in this project is entered by user itself.

## Challenges

Curentlly this calculator is useful only for 2-D shapes, and is not useful for 3-D shapes

## What next?

It can become more useful if we can provide it as many shapes and formulas as possible, and make sure that it has every single shape in it.
